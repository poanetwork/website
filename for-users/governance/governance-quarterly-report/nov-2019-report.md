# Nov 2019 Report

## Summary

✅ The POA network is governed by a dynamic validator set. A new validator was added to the set and several validators were removed. The current validator set along with Notary Licensure details can be viewed here \(select POA Network in Network Dropdown\): [https://validators.poa.network/poa-dapps-validators](https://validators.poa.network/poa-dapps-validators)

✅ A measure was proposed to reduce the minimal number of votes required to pass some types of future ballots \(ballots related to adding/removing validators and reducing/increasing consensus thresholds\). This measure passed, and the number was reduced from 8 to 5 required votes. This means future votes will require at least 5 participants, with a majority of "yes" votes needed to pass a measure. 

✅  A measure to automatically redirect emission funds to the POA Foundation was proposed and approved. Previously, [emission fund outcomes were voted on by validators](https://forum.poa.network/t/emission-funds-3-results/2957).  The result of this vote provides financial support to the POA Foundation team to aid future development efforts and accelerate [POA token use-case expansion](../../../roadmap.md#poa-token-use-case-expansion).
