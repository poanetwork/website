## Why do CoinMarketCap & CoinGecko show different valuations for POA?

Binance was responsible for nearly 100% of the trading volume for POA. Since it has been delisted, there is very little liquidity or trading options for the POA token. Tracking varies between these 2 services, and they are picking up different listings for their metrics. Either way, volume is very low and valuation may not reflect actual trade value or ability to trade. The aggregators are here for reference.

## What about POA20 on Ethereum. Is it available to swap?

Yes, but first you must move it back to POA Network. You can move back to POA using the POA bridge. Gas fees are paid in Eth when bridging. POA20 is an ERC20 on Ethereum that is originally bridged from POA. It must be bridged back to complete the swap.
