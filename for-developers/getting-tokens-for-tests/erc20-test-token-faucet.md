# ERC20 Test Token Faucet

The [ERC20 Token Faucet](https://erc20faucet.com) by [peppersec](https://peppersec.com) provides a sleek and easy interface for ERC20 test token creation.&#x20;

The faucet can quickly generate any number of FAU (FAUCET) tokens directly from a web interface. These tokens are then available for developers to test smart contract applications and any other token transfer functionality.

### Prerequisites

* Network wallet address loaded with enough native currency (POA) to cover the transaction.
* Web3 wallet interface such as MetaMask or [NiftyWallet](../../for-users/nifty-wallet/). In this tutorial we use [NiftyWallet](https://forum.poa.network/t/nifty-wallet-is-back-on-the-chrome-store/2408).

ERC20 Token Faucet can also be used with [Portis](https://www.portis.io) or [Squarelink](https://squarelink.com).

### Steps

1\) Go to [https://erc20faucet.com/](https://erc20faucet.com)**. **Check that your web3 wallet (ie NiftyWallet) is connected to the POA network. If you change this after step 3, you will need to reconnect.

**2**)  Click **Connect**.

3\) Select **Metamask.**

4\) Once selected, the web interface will populate with your Address, Network and Balance information.

* 1\) Select the **Amount of tokens** you would like to create.
* 2\) Click the **Mint Free Tokens** button.

![Select Amount and click Mint Free Tokens](<../../.gitbook/assets/mint (1).png>)

4\) Your web3 wallet interface should open. Check the transaction and click **Submit** to confirm. You will see a Success message if the transaction is successful.

![Click Submit to confirm](<../../.gitbook/assets/confirm (1).png>)

5\) The tokens have been minted on your address! To view them, you will need to add the Token Address to your wallet.

* A) Copy the Token Address, open your NiftyWallet, and click Add Token in the Tokens tab.

![Click Add Token](../../.gitbook/assets/fau51.png)

* B) Select the Custom tab, and paste in the Token Address from the website. The Token Symbol and Decimals should populate automatically. Click **Add**.

* C) You should see your new FAU balance in the wallet. _(Note there are 16 FAU tokens due to a previous balance of 11, and 5 were added through this transaction.)_

To mint FAU tokens on another network, such as the xDai Chain, simply switch the network you are connected to in your web3 wallet, and follow the process above.
