* **Date**: 2018-10-22
* **Block number**: 5329160

## Description

#### Problems

* Governance smart contracts are non-upgradable.
* Feature request: we need to increase emission supply for self-sustainability of the network ([poanetwork/RFC#14](https://github.com/poanetwork/RFC/issues/14)).
* Feature request: there is no ability to create one ballot for three keys ([poanetwork/poa-network-consensus-contracts#92](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-network-consensus-contracts/issues/92)).
* Feature request: there is no ability to finalize ballot earlier if all validators voted before the end of a ballot ([poanetwork/RFC#8](https://github.com/poanetwork/RFC/issues/8)).
* DApp performance: There are no tuple getters in smart contracts. It leads to the low performance of `Voting DApp`.
* `pragma solidity ^0.4.18;` used for governance smart contracts is outdated.
* Smart contracts need to be refactored in order to make them easy to read.
* Smart contracts need to be checked for security and design issues ([audit report by MixBytes team](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-network-consensus-contracts/blob/a9f63b19e5e4f0f238211d0cd8c456ad384d4a6c/audit/MixBytes/PoA%20Consensus%20Audit.pdf), [audit report by ChainSecurity team](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-network-consensus-contracts/blob/8575766ecdd58fb85c40c0f2a1df0701abcd0ba5/audit/ChainSecurity/ChainSecurity\_PoA.pdf)).
* Minor bugs.

## Solution

1. Deploy [new smart contracts](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-network-consensus-contracts/tree/31fa251ab0d299ba7b70f2fd03ceb5fd04ad5950) and migrate all the data from old to new contracts with [`scripts/migrate/migrateAll.js`](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-network-consensus-contracts/tree/31fa251ab0d299ba7b70f2fd03ceb5fd04ad5950/scripts/migrate/migrateAll.js).
2. Update [`poa-chain-spec/contracts.json`](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-chain-spec/blob/core/contracts.json).
3. Update [`poa-chain-spec/abis`](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-chain-spec/tree/core/abis).
4. Update [`poa-chain-spec/spec.json`](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-chain-spec/blob/core/spec.json):
5. add an address of the new `PoaNetworkConsensus` contract to `engine/authorityRound/params/validators/multi`;
6. add `blockRewardContractAddress` (obtained from step 1) and `blockRewardContractTransition` (equal to `5761140` - `November 17th, 2018`) to `engine/authorityRound/params`.
7. Organize the HF on block `5329160`.

## Increased Emission Supply

In the scope of this hard fork, the emission supply will be increased by 1 POA per block.

POA has a block time of **\~5** seconds and rewards each validated block miner **1 POA** for each block. These block rewards never run out and after `November 17th, 2018` there will be **2 POA** minted per block. The remaining **1 POA** per block will be put aside to benefit the network however the current Validators vote to choose, some example use cases are to Burn coins, hold coins or spend on R\&D for the POA Foundation. Validator's reward will remain at **1 POA** after this transition.

You can find more info located in the [POA Whitepaper Economy Section](https://github.com/poanetwork/wiki/wiki/POA-Network-Whitepaper#economy) and [RFC issue #14](https://github.com/poanetwork/RFC/issues/14).

### Instructions

* [Update Parity](../parity-upgrade-guide.md) to** **version `>=1.11`.
* [Update spec.json](poa-core-spec.json-hard-fork-update.md)&#x20;

## Verify HF block number:

```
grep -n -A2 5329160 spec.json
```

You should see:

```
"5329160": { "safeContract": "0xa105Db0e6671C7B5f4f350ff1Af6460E6C696e71" }
```
