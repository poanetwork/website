# Upgrade Instance to a Larger Instance Type

1. Login to your AWS console. In "Services" select "EC2" and navigate to "Instances" > "Instances" in the left sidebar. You should see a list of all your instances in the current region, similar to this:  Select the instance you want to upgrade. **Double check IP address to verify that you're upgrading correct node from correct network**\
   ****
2. Click "Actions", from dropdown select "Instance State" > "Stop"  \
   Confirm the instance you want to stop.\

3. Wait until "Instance state" changes to "stopped", then click "Actions" and select "Instance settings" > "Change instance type"  Select the new instance type (e.g. `t2.xlarge`)  Click **OK** to confirm.\

4. Check that value in "Instance type" column on the instances list was updated|\

5. Click "Actions", then "Instance state" > "Start" \

6. Wait until "Instance state" changes to "running". Also check in netstat dashboard ([sokol netstat](https://sokol-netstat.poa.network)/[core netstat](https://core-netstat.poa.network)) that your node is green and catching up. This may take some time to settle down.\

7. Back to AWS page, it is important that **After upgrade your node's public IP address will change**. You should note and save the new IP address in "IPv4 Public IP" column.\

8. Login to your node via ssh, e.g.

```
ssh root@192.0.2.1
```

&#x20;   9\. Edit parity configuration file to update your public ip address. To do this open file in your favourite text editor (e.g. `nano`)

```
nano /home/validator/node.toml
```

Search for a row similar to

```
nat = "extip:192.0.2.1"
```

change IP address in this line to a new one, e.g.

```
nat = "extip:192.0.2.2"
```

Save and exit text editor (for `nano`, press CTRL+X then y).

10\.   Restart parity and netstats

```
sudo systemctl restart poa-parity
```

Restart netstats

```
sudo systemctl restart poa-netstats
```

11\.  Check again that your node is green in netstats.
