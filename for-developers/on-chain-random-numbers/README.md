# On-Chain Random Numbers

We are introducing an on-chain RNG based on RANDAO. It may be leveraged by smart contract developers to introduce random numbers into their applications. _Note that random numbers are limited to certain blocks in the current implementation. See below for more information._

The following article explains on-chain randomness functions and how they will be used when POSDAO is implemented. It includes concepts and an example, and is a good place to start.

The current implementation requires a chain running OpenEthereum AuRa consensus mechanism with version 2.7.2+. The Random Number generation contract was [introduced in this PR](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/10946).
