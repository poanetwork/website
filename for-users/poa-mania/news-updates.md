{% endhint %}

* The new version will move to [poamania.com](https://poamania.com), replacing the previous version.\

## **If you have deposits in the previous version of POA Mania:**

Your funds are SAFU! However, you must withdraw them from the old version of the application. To withdraw, go to [beta.poamania.com](https://beta.poamania.com), connect your wallet and start the withdrawal process. If needed, see the [withdrawal process here](deposit-withdraw.md).

You can then redeposit POA (noting the new 50k max limit) into the new version.

The new version replaces the prior version at [poamania.com](http://poamania.com), with the new rules and reset jackpot.
