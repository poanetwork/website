# POA Mania on Trust Wallet

You can access [POA Mania](https://www.poamania.com) with a mobile device web browser connected to a web3 wallet, or use a POA supported mobile wallet. Here, we use [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/) to connect to the POA Network and deposit POA into POA Mania.

## Getting Started

1\) Open your Trust Multi-coin wallet.  POA is supported natively in Trust Wallet!  If you don't see the POA Icon, press the + button in the upper-right hand corner, search for POA and toggle on. POA Network is now visible in your wallet.  You can also create a new multi-coin wallet or import an existing wallet if you prefer.  If you don't have POA coins in this wallet, you can send POA to this wallet address as you normally would \(see [resources](poa-mania-on-trustwallet.md#resources) for basic trust wallet features\).

3\) Switch to the POA Network \(if needed\)

If using a multi-coin wallet, the Ethereum network may be selected by default. To change, click on the icon in the upper-right hand corner and select POA Network from the dropdown list.

8\) Each day a participant can close a round \(the button appears when a round is complete\). When this happens, 3 addresses are drawn as winners. To withdraw, follow a similar process to above but instead of Deposit click **Withdraw**. See other [POA Mania ](./)topics for more info.

You can check previous winners in the winners tab and receive daily updates by following PoaMania on twitter.
