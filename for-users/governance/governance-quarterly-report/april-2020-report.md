# April 2020 Report

## Summary

✅ Several validators were voted out of the set by the current validators. Three validators on POA Core \(1 at their own request\) and 4 on Sokol \(2 at their own request\). This reflects the current validator's desires to maintain active governance and secure consensus process. The validators removed were falling behind on node updates, endangering the stability of the system. The current validator set along with Notary Licensure details can be viewed here \(select POA Network in Network Dropdown\): [https://validators.poa.network/poa-dapps-validators](https://validators.poa.network/poa-dapps-validators)

✅ A bug was discovered in the RewardByBlock contract related to validator removal. If a validator being removed was the same validator who seals the block with the removal finalization, the network could be critically impacted. Developers pushed a fix and the validators voted overwhelmingly to implement it before finalizing the removal of several validators. This process took a good deal of coordination amongst validators to ensure success. 

✅  A measure to support POA Mania with a Block Reward Adjustment was proposed on the Sokol network. This proposal would programatically distribute the funding for the savings lottery. The ballot failed to pass, receiving 7 of the required 8 votes. However, changes to the validator set meant that the voting threshold was lowered \(changed from 8 to 7 required votes\) and the measure was proposed again. It is currently in process; we will report the results here when balloting is complete.
