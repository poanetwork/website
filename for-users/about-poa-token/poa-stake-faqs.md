## I can't see my POA in my wallet

Likely you are not connected to the POA network.&#x20;

Ethereum and POA Network externally owned addresses **** can co-exist on multiple chains. Switch the network to Mainnet to see tokens on Ethereum, and switch to POA Network to see tokens on POA (or xDai to see your balances on the xDai chain).&#x20;

To switch networks in MetaMask, click on the Network dropdown to select. **Note that POA and xDai are not native to MetaMask, so you will need to add them as custom networks. Instructions are below.**

## I'm having trouble moving POA out of Binance

You can withdraw POA from Binance and send it to an external address that you control on the POA Network (an 0x wallet address that you have access to).&#x20;

Once it is on POA, follow the [swap process outlined here](poa-merger-and-stake-swap.md).

#### **Withdraw from Binance**

1\) Download and install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io).

2\) Add the POA Network. You can visit [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org/,) to add.

3\) Login to Binance and click Withdraw, withdraw crypto.

## What is the current POA price?

Valuations in your wallet may differ from what you receive when swapping. The rate for the swap is **466.6163443 POA per 1 STAKE,**  so the actual valuation is based on this rate.

Binance was responsible for nearly 100% of the trading volume for POA. Since it has been delisted, there is very little liquidity or trading options for the POA token.&#x20;

Tracking varies between tracking services and is not likely accurate.  Volume is very low and valuation may not reflect actual trade value or ability to trade.&#x20;

## What is POA20 on Ethereum?

POA20 is an ERC20 equivalent of POA that is on Ethereum rather than POA Network. Learn More Here

To swap POA20, it should first be bridged back to the POA Network. Here are some instructions (note gas fees to bridge from POA20 to POA can be expensive, and must be paid with ETH)

## What is the POA contract address?

POA does not have a contract address, it is the native token on the POA network (like ETH is the native token on Ethereum). To send, you need to be on the POA network.  If you [swap to xDai](poa-merger-and-stake-swap.md), it will be wrapped POA (WPOA) on the xDai chain. The address for **WPOA on xDai** is [0x9fe3864F9Ae7cfb5668Dae90C0e20c4C3D437664 ](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/token/0x9fe3864F9Ae7cfb5668Dae90C0e20c4C3D437664/token-transfers)

## How do I add WPOA to my wallet view on xDai?

Here we use Metamask as an example.

1. Switch to the xDai Network ([How to add xDai network to your MetaMask](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup))
2. Go to Assets
3. Press Import Tokens

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/MM 1-3.png>)

    The remaining info should autopopulate.&#x20;
2. Press **Add Custom Token**.

&#x20;![](../../.gitbook/assets/import-2.png)

You should now see WPOA along with your balance.&#x20;

1. Press **Import Tokens** to finalize&#x20;
2. You will now see the amount of WPOA in your balance
