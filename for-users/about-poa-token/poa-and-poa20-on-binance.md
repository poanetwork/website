# POA & POA20 on Binance

A large majority of POA trading volume is currently carried out on Binance (www.binance.com - not accessible from a US i.p. address). A Binance wallet can be funded with either POA or POA20 to start trading with POA.

1\)  In Binance, go to **Wallet** -> **Spot Wallet** in the top menu.

3\) In your wallet of choice, send the funds to the specified address. To **deposit POA**, make sure your wallet is connected to the **POA network** when completing the transaction. To **deposit POA20**, connect to the **Ethereum Mainnet** and select to send POA20 to the same address.

2. Select POA from the coin dropdown.
3. Select the POA network (ERC20 network will not work).
4. Enter the address to withdraw to.
