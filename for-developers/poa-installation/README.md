# Full Node Setup

{% hint style="info" %}
You do not need to run your own node to interact with the POA blockchain \(play games, send and receive funds, and use DApps\). Running a node can be thought of as a public service - it benefits the decentralization and overall security of the chain, and allows you to confirm the chain state using your own instance.

## POA Network Support:

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: While OE still works fine with POA network, it will be deprecated in the future. [Nethermind](install-nethermind-client.md) is the recommended client for new installations.
