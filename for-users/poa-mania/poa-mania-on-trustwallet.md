# POA Mania on TrustWallet

You can access with a mobile device connected to a web3 wallet, or use a POA supported mobile wallet. Here, we use [TrustWallet](https://trustwallet.com/) to connect to the POA Network and deposit POA into POA Mania.

1\) Open TrustWallet and connect to your POA Network wallet. If you don't have a POA Wallet setup in TrustWallet yet, you can create a new multi-coin wallet or import an existing wallet.  Once created or imported, press the + button and toggle on the POA Network to add the network to your wallet. If you don't have POA coins, you can send it to this wallet as you normally would \(see instructions below for basic trust wallet features\).

6\) Each day a participant can close a round \(the button appears when a round is complete\). When this happens, 3 addresses are drawn as winners. To withdraw, follow a similar process to above but instead of Deposit click **Withdraw**. See other [POA Mania ](./)topics for more info.

You can check previous winners in the winners tab and receive daily updates by following PoaMania on twitter.
