## About Nifty Wallet

Nifty Wallet is a full-featured browser wallet built for interacting with web3 applications. Originally forked from MetaMask, Nifty Wallet has been refactored by POA to include an expanded list of RPC endpoints and expanded to include features like the ability to interact with contracts, connect to a decentralized node network, and more.

Nifty Wallet is the preferred browser-based wallet for interaction with POA Core and POA Sokol.&#x20;
